# Maven-Healthcare-Challenge
This project was created to design a modern dashboard exploring the useful insights related to the National &amp; state-level results from 2013 to 2022 for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, including hospital-level completions and response rates.
This project was achieved using Power BI, the steps taken are as follows :

1- Importing the data and creating the model :
In this step the different csv files were loaded into the report and then the data model was designed with the implementation of the different relationships between the tables to guarantee a dynamic changing report across all the visuals.

2- Transforming, cleaning and preparing the data :
In this step, the data cleaning of the missing values was achieved, with creating new measures to guarantee useful insights (Year over year percentages, dissatisfaction levels aggregates...), and finally to prepare the data a useful table has been added to load the longitude and latitude of the different states to prepare a map projection.

3- Dashboard design :
The final step designing the dashboard in a modern minimalist way, with a dark theme to ease the eye, the UI/UX is native and user-friendly, this dashboard also offers useful insights in these main subjects:
  - Hospitals' HCAHPS scores over the years.
  - Areas where hospitals have made progress and major areas of opportunity.

Thank you!
